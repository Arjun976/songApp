I cannot provide you with an `ngrok` URL directly because it needs to be generated by running the `ngrok` tool on your own computer. This tool creates a temporary, public URL that securely tunnels requests from the internet to your local server.

Here are the steps to get your own `ngrok` URL:

### Step 1: Download and Install ngrok

1.  Go to the official `ngrok` website: **[https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)**
2.  Download the version for your operating system (Windows, in your case).
3.  Unzip the downloaded file. This will give you a single executable file, `ngrok.exe`.

### Step 2: Connect Your Account (Recommended)

1.  Sign up for a free account on the `ngrok` website.
2.  After signing up, you will find your **authtoken** on your dashboard.
3.  Open a command prompt (or terminal) in the folder where you unzipped `ngrok.exe` and run the command they provide, which will look like this:
    ```sh
    ./ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN_HERE
    ```
    This step is recommended as it gives you longer tunnel durations and more features.

### Step 3: Start the Tunnel

1.  In the same command prompt, start `ngrok` to forward to your backend's port (which is `5000`):
    ```sh
    ./ngrok http 5000
    ```

### Step 4: Get the URL

1.  After running the command, `ngrok` will display a session status screen in your terminal. Look for the line that starts with **`Forwarding`**. It will show two URLs, one `http` and one `https` (secure).

    ```
    Session Status                online
    Account                       Your Name (Plan: Free)
    Version                       x.x.x
    Region                        United States (us)
    Forwarding                    http://xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
    Forwarding                    https://xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000  <-- USE THIS ONE

    Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
    Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                                  0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
    ```

2.  **Copy the `https://` URL.** It will look something like `https://a1b2-c3d4-e5f6.ngrok.io`. This is your temporary public URL.

### Step 5: Use the URL in Stripe

1.  Go to your Stripe Dashboard's webhook settings.
2.  For the "Endpoint URL", paste the `ngrok` URL you copied and add your webhook path to the end of it:
    **`https://<your-ngrok-url>.ngrok.io/api/payments/webhook`**

Now, Stripe can send webhook events to this public URL, and `ngrok` will forward them to your local server, allowing you to test your integration end-to-end. Remember that every time you restart `ngrok`, you will get a new public URL, and you'll have to update it in your Stripe dashboard.
